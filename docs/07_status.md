# Project Status — Ops AI Cortex

## Current Phase
🧱 **Architecture & scaffold complete**  
📄 Documentation drafted (scope, architecture, tech stack, milestones)  
🚧 Implementation phase beginning (service layer + data models)

## What’s Done
- Project structure initialized (`src/ops_ai_cortex/...`)
- Docs folder drafted with full design intent
- Tech stack finalized: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, MLflow/W&B planned
- CI/CD + container layout planned but not implemented

## Next Milestones
| Target | ETA |
|--------|-----|
| Implement core service layer | Jan 2026 |
| Add experiment tracking + DB persistence | Feb 2026 |
| Deploy MVP API + docs | Mar 2026 |

## Notes
This repo is intentionally being built "docs-first" to model real engineering lifecycle:  
design → scaffold → implement → deploy → refine.

If you're a reviewer: code implementation begins shortly; architecture is already locked.
